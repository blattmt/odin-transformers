# odin-transformers
Project intended to create a website using HTML only.
Originally intended to be page with links and pictures of recipes
I am altering it to be about some of my favorite Transformers

This task had me practice making sure the boilerplate was being used and correct, naming tabs, using links to different pages, and adding images. It also provided some repetition with using basic git commands like status, add, and commit.
