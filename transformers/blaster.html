        <h1>Blaster</h1>
        <img src="blaster.jpg" alt="Transformer Blaster holding his blaster">
        <p>Everyone who enjoys transformers will undoubtedly know the Decepticon Soundwave.
            However, I've always tended toward the Autobots. Fortunately, they have
            their own version in for the form of <strong>Blaster!</strong></p>
        
        <p>As though created to be the exact opposite, Blaster posseses significantly 
            more charisma and is frequently talking. Going so far as to even be a
            radio personality in some continuities.</p>
            
        <p>Similarly to Shockwave, Blaster houses some Mini-Cassette Autobots
            within his chest cavity. Some of those include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ramhorn</li>
            <li>Steeljaw</li>
            <li>Rewind</li>
            <li>Eject</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Like all transformers, he has had a slew of alternate formes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cassette Player</li>
            <li>Cybertronian Sonic Tank</li>
            <li>Cybertronian Stealth Bomber</li>
            <li>Satelite Laptop</li>
        </ol>
